<p>After writing a post about one interesting way to arrive at a closed-form for the $n$th term of the Fibonacci sequence, a friend pointed out a few alternative ways to get there, one of which felt particularly natural. It requires some linear algebra, so I guess that in some sense, it could be considered ‚Äúunnatural,‚Äù but I especially like it because the argument‚Äôs flow requires fewer arbitrary-seeming leaps. With that said, this post will be brief (as I‚Äôm a little busy at the moment), so if there‚Äôs anything that doesn‚Äôt make sense or is incorrect, please do reach out and let me know.</p>

<h2 id="fibonacci-matrix">Fibonacci matrix</h2>

<p>The Fibonacci sequence can be viewed through the lens of matrices. In particular, if we start with the matrix</p>
<div>
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},
$$
</div>
<p>we can see that the Fibonacci sequence can be materialized by repeatedly multiplying $A$ by itself.</p>

<p>To see this, first notice that if we are considering the Fibonacci sequence that starts with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$, then we note that</p>
<div>
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} F_2 &amp; F_1 \\ F_1 &amp; F_0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
</div>
<p>Suppose now that</p>
<div>
$$
A^{n-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{n-1} = \begin{bmatrix} F_{n-1} &amp; F_{n-2} \\ F_{n-2} &amp; F_{n-3} \end{bmatrix}
$$
</div>
<p>for $n \geq 3$. Then</p>
<div>
$$
A^n = A^{n-1}A = \begin{bmatrix} F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} &amp; F_{n-2} + F_{n-3} \\ F_{n-2} + F_{n-3} &amp; F_{n-2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} F_n &amp; F_{n-1} \\ F_{n-1} &amp; F_{n-2} \end{bmatrix}.
$$
</div>
<p>Thus, to get the $n$th element of the Fibonacci sequence, we need only get the upper left entry of $A^n$. If we had a fast way to obtain $A^n$ instead of actually carrying out iterated matrix multiplication, we could obtain the $n$th element without doing very much work.</p>

<h2 id="diagonalizing-a">Diagonalizing $A$</h2>

<p>To do this, we will look to diagonalize $A$. This means that we will try to write</p>
<div>
$$
A = VDV^{-1}
$$
</div>
<p>where $D$ is a diagonal matrix and $V$ is a matrix with eigenvectors of $A$ as columns (we have to actually find $D$ and $V$ that work). What‚Äôs nice about a diagonal representation is that</p>
<div>
$$
A^n = (VDV^{-1})^n = VDV^{-1}VDV^{-1}\dots VDV^{-1} = VD^nV^{-1}.
$$
</div>
<p>If $D$ is written as a matrix with $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ on the diagonal, then $D^n$ is simply $D$ with the elements on the diagonal each taken to the $n$th power, like so:</p>
<div>
$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda_2 \end{bmatrix} \implies D^n = \begin{bmatrix} \lambda_1^n &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda_2^n \end{bmatrix}.
$$
</div>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve laid out our approach, it‚Äôs time to carry it out. (I will spare the algebra required to keep this post brief.)</p>

<h2 id="using-eigenvalues">Using eigenvalues</h2>

<p>The eigenvalues of $A$ (as you might expect if you read my last post) are $\lambda_1,\lambda_2 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2}$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are $v_1, v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2} \ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Thus, we have</p>
<div>
$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2} \end{bmatrix} ~~~~ V = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2} &amp; \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2} \\ 1 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}.
$$
</div>
<p>With these in hand, we see that $A$ is indeed diagonalizable, so that $A^n$ can be written as $VD^nV^{-1}$, and voila! with two matrix multiplications and exponentiating the diagonal entries of $D$, we can very quickly and efficiently come up with large Fibonacci numbers quickly.</p>
