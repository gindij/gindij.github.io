I"a<p>After writing a post about one interesting way to arrive at a closed-form for the (n)th term of the Fibonacci sequence, a friend pointed out a few alternative ways to get there, one of which felt particularly natural. It requires some linear algebra, so I guess that in some sense, it could be considered “unnatural,” but I especially like it because the argument’s flow requires fewer arbitrary-seeming leaps. With that said, this post will be brief (as I’m a little busy at the moment), so if there’s anything that doesn’t make sense or is incorrect, please do reach out and let me know.</p>
