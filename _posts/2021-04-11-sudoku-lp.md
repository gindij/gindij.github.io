## Introduction
During the last several months, my wife and I went through a Kenken phase. For
those not familiar with Kenken, check out this [website](https://www.kenkenpuzzle.com).
Kenken is a great example of a class of problems that are more broadly categorized as
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). I wrote some code that generates and solves Kenkens,
which I'd like to write about when I have more time, but in this post I want to talk about
an interesting, nonstandard way to set up and solve a different, far more popular CSP: sudoku!

## What is sudoku?
For those who are not familiar with sudoku puzzles, they are designed as follows.
The initial board is a 9x9, partially filled in grid. The goal is for the solver
to find (the unique) values for the empty squares so that the board satisfies the following
rules:
1. There can be no repeated values in any row. (Each row must contain each value
  from 1 up to 9 exactly once.)
2. There can be no repeated values in any column. (Each column must contain each
  value from 1 up to 9 exactly once.)
3. There can be no repeated values in each of the 9 3x3 groups of cells outlined
  in a bolded black line in the figures below.

## Modeling the problem
In order to formulate this as an optimization problem we need to come up with a
variable to optimize and constraints that tell the optimization algorithm what kinds
of solutions are valid. In any sudoku problem, there are 81 cells that need to
be filled in (including those that are already populated at the start). Each of those
cells has 9 possible values, so we will index our variable $x$ with 3 indices: the first
will indicate the row, the second will indicate the column, and the third will refer to a
value between 1 and 9. Furthermore, each $x_{ijk}$ will be either 0 or 1: 1 if the cell
at position $(i, j)$ on the board has the value $k$ and 0 otherwise.

This way of modeling a sudoku board is not the most intuitive one possible, but it
will make formulating our constraints easier, which is the topic we turn to next. (If
the above wasn't clear, give it another read before moving on.)

## Constraints
There are a few types of constraints we need to respect to make sure that our
optimization algorithm comes up with a valid solution to our sudoku problems. We
will discuss each type of constraint in turn.

### Respecting given values
The first constraint the solution needs to satisfy is that the values that are
already provided must be respected. That is, if the first cell is already
filled with the value 5, the optimizer is not allowed to change that. By the way
we defined $x$ earlier, this would correspond to the constraint $x_{115} = 1$. Similarly,
if the lower right value were set to 1, we would have another constraint corresponding
to this value given by $x_{991} = 1$. We add a constraint like this for every value
that is provided on the initial board.

### Each cell contains a single value
This is a relatively simple constraint, but an important one. To model this constraint
for cell $(1, 1)$, we would require that $\sum_{k=1}^9 x_{11k} = 1$. Because each
entry of $x$ is either 0 or 1, this constraint says that exactly one of the entries
corresponding to the first cell must be set. We add a constraint like the one I described
for the first cell for each of the 81 cells.

### Row, column, and box constraints
We require that each row contain each digit from 1 to 9 . To encode that the digits
in row $i$ must be unique, we need to make sure that for each value $k$, we have
$\sum_{j=1}^9 x_{ijk} = 1$ (in the sum, $i$ and $k$ are fixed). There are 81 such
constraints corresponding to the rows, another 81 can be analogously formulated
for the columns, and another 81 can be formulated to model the box constraints.

Once we've modeled all the constraints, we can stack them into a single matrix
equality constraint $Ax = b$. Although we've been discussing $x$ as though
it were three dimensional, when we pass the optimization problem to the computer, we
flatten it into one long 729-vector (9 rowx $\times$ 9 columns $\times$ 9
candidate values per cell). Each row of $A$ corresponds to a single constraint.
Coefficients corresponding to the variables that are active in that constraint
are set to 1 and the other coefficients in that row are all set to 0. Because
all of our constraints have 1s on their right hand sides, we have $b = \mathbf 1$.

## Formulating and solving the problem
We can now formulate our optimization problem:
<div>
\begin{align*}
  &\underset{x \in \{0, 1\}^{729}}{\text{minimize}} ~~ 0\\
  &\text{subject to} ~~ Ax = \mathbf 1.
\end{align*}
</div>
Because sudokus have unique solutions, we just need to find the $x$ that satisfies
our constraints -- the objective value doesn't matter for this problem.

With the optimization problem in hand, the following short piece of code
uses [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org) any sudoku puzzle very quickly:
```python
# ... <code that formulates the constraints> ...

x = cp.Variable(N, boolean=True)
A = np.array(list(constrs))
b = np.ones(len(constrs))

# because the solution is unique, this is just a feasibility problem
objective = cp.Minimize(0)
constraints = [A @ x == b]
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve(solver=cp.ECOS_BB)
```
The full code (~100 lines) can be found [here](https://github.com/gindij/SudokuLP).

## Conclusion
Sudoku is typically framed and solved as a CSP with
algorithms that involve some guessing and checking. I thought this was an interesting
application of optimization to a problem that maybe doesn't immediately lend itself
to such a formulation. Hope you enjoyed!
