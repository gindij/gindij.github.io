<p>My name is Jack Gindi. I just completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UPenn in May 2017 after completing a bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from UPenn). In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing, writing (check out my blog <a href="https://whatabouttheory.quora.com/">here</a>), and reading. You can find me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jackegindi">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gindij">GitHub</a>. This site has some details about my academic and work experiences.</p>
