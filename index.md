My name is Jack Gindi. I just completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UPenn in May 2017 after completing a bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from UPenn). In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing, writing (check out my blog [here](https://whatabouttheory.quora.com/)), and reading. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jackegindi) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gindij). This site has some details about my academic and work experiences.
