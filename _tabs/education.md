Since having an opportunity to explore it deeply in college, I've always enjoyed
my studies in across math and computer science. Some of the interesting courses
I took during college include:
* Abstract algebra (2 semesters), real (2 semesters) and complex analysis
* Algorithms, advanced algorithms (randomized)
* Advanced (functional) programming in Haskell, (theory of) programming languages
* Distributed systems, operating systems
* Cryptography
* Programming and problem solving
* Artificial intelligence
* Engineering entrepreneurship

Since leaving school, I've continued studying interesting and growing areas of CS/math,
including having taken courses:
* [Probability theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo) (Harvard, YouTube), statistical inference (Columbia, in-person)
* [Reinforcement learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) (University of Alberta, Coursera)
* [Convex optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) (Stanford, in-person)

During the course of my studies, I've also realized how important and fundamental
linear algebra is, so I've gone through a couple of textbooks to cement my understanding
of the subject, on both the theoretical ([Linear Algebra Done Right](https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/file_spring2018/linear_algebra_done_right.pdf), [Intro to Applied Linear Algebra](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/))
and numerical ([Numerical Linear Algebra](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Lloyd-Trefethen/dp/0898713617)) sides.
