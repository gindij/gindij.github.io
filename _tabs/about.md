My name is Jack Gindi. I currently work at [Goldman
Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com) as a quant
strategist (Strat) in the Quantitative Investment
Strategies (QIS) within Goldman Sachs Asset Management
([GSAM](https://www.gsam.com/)).

Before Goldman, I worked as a quant developer / research
engineer in the [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual) AI Labs. Over my (approximately) three years
there, I worked on projects in machine learning and
optimization, with applications to optimal wealth
management in retirement (decumulation), tax-aware
portfolio construction, and securities lending. Before
working at BlackRock, I was a data platform engineer at
a startup called [OpenGov](https://opengov.com). You can
find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackegindi/).

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at
UPenn in May 2017 after completing a bachelor's in
Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from
UPenn).

In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing,
reading, and writing.
