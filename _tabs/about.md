My name is Jack Gindi. I currently work in New York as a quant developer in the [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual) AI Labs.
Over the past three years, I've worked on projects in machine learning and, more recently, optimization. Before working at BlackRock, I was a data platform engineer at a startup called [OpenGov](https://opengov.com). You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackegindi/).

I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at UPenn in May 2017 after completing a bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2016 (also from UPenn).

In my free time, I love playing basketball, singing, reading, and writing.
